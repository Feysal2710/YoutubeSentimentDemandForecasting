## Overview

This project is part of a university thesis exploring how sentiment extracted from YouTube car review comments can support **demand forecasting** in the automotive sector.

It involves:

- Training and evaluating various machine learning and deep learning models
- Applying the best sentiment models to unlabeled YouTube data
- Preparing sentiment time-series data for future demand forecasting (not yet in this repo)
